### About

**Website Admin Finder** It's a lightweight application for Android that allows you to audit the security of websites in search of the admin panel automatically. It relies on brute force requests to find the panel.

I didn't find a similar application or software, I needed to have this type of tools within my reach, so I thought about developing it, and why not, making it public, free and open source.

### Characteristics
- <b>light</b>: It doesn't use too many resources and avoided using too many vectors to conserve size and improve performance.<br /><br />
- <b>Multiple scan</b>: you can import your own wordlist of websites to scan more than one site at a time.<br /><br />
- <b>Real time log</b>: Shows a log in real time to notify you that you have found a website.<br /><br />
- <b>Background service</b>: You don't want to have the application in the foreground or wait? No problem; With notifications you will be notified of the results.<br /><br />
- <b>Persistence</b>: Did you forget which website you scaned or which administration panels you could find? Don't worry, the application keeps a record of the log and the positive results as well.<br /><br />
- <b>Exact time</b>: If you need to know the exact time of each request, the application can save the exact hour, minutes, seconds and even milliseconds.

### Create WorldList

To scan multiple sites at the same time, you can create a WorldList that contains the url of the websites you want to scan. The "syntax" is simple, first create a txt file in storage, open it with any text editor and just make sure to stack the links on top of each other. 

A simple example would be:

*WordList.txt*

<code>https://example1.com
https://example2.net
https://ejemplo.xyz
</code>

### Attention

**Notice** that the speed of the analysis will not be based on the programming logic of the application. 40% is based on your internet speeds and 60% is based on the website's servers. As far as I know, there is nothing that we can do with that.
